Final Project

* Create a website for a sports team that will allow the user to obtain information about the team,
  including players, player profiles, and schedules. Additionally, the user will be able to purchase
  team themed merchandise, as well as tickets to games. This is primarily an e-commerce website.

* The user will be able to access the team roster, consisting of information for each player, including
  name, number, age, height, weight, and birthplace, etc.

* The user will be able to access the player profile by clicking on a player name. The profile will
  consist of the player's name, picture, date acquired, and date drafted, etc.  If the user is an admin,
  the edit and delete links will be displayed, otherwise they will not. An admin user is in the seed file
  (name: tjl, email: tlynch@example.org, passwoerd: comet)

* The e-commerce functionality of the website will allow the user to view products by category type.

* Each category will contain various products. A product page will show the product name, a picture
  of the product, the price, and product description.

* Products can be selected to add to shopping cart.

* Additionally, tickets to games can be selected and added to the user's shopping cart.

* Upon checkout, an order will be created for products in the shopping cart. Each order will have
  an order date.

* The user will confirm the order and make payment using a credit card. A credit card will have
  a credit card number and expiration date.

* Users are able to post reviews of products, and see all reviews posted for a given product.

* Views for updating, deleting and creating new players and products are visible/accessible to
  a user who is an admin. Seed file contains user "admin" email "admin@example.org" password "nimda"

* Deployment to public url: https://tjlfinal.herokuapp.com
